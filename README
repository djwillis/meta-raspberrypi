 OpenEmbedded BSP Layer - RaspberryPi
--------------------------------------

This is the general hardware specific BSP overlay for the RaspberryPi device.
It should be used with openembedded-core (not old-style org.openembedded.dev).

More information can be found at:

                   http://www.raspberrypi.org/ (Official Site)
                   http://www.distant-earth.com/ (My Site)

Build scripts patched to support making a firmware image for the RaspberryPi with Angstrom can be found at:

                   http://github.com/Angstrom-distribution/setup-scripts

When not depending on meta-openembedded and not using systemd, you may need to
mask few recipes requiring systemd or other recipes not included in your distribution of choice.

You can achieve this by adding something like the following to local.conf:

BBMASK = "meta-raspberrypi/recipes-multimedia/libav|meta-raspberrypi/recipes-core/systemd"

You can adjust the BBMASK for any .bbappends that your distribution does not contain recipes for.

The core BSP part of meta-raspberrypi should work with different OpenEmbedded/Yocto
distributions and layer stacks, such as:

* Distro-less (only with OE-Core).
* Angstrom (main focus of testing).
* Yocto/Poky.

This layer in its entirety depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: master
revision: HEAD

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
branch: master
revision: HEAD
